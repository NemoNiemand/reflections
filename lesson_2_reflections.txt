What happens when you initialize a repository?  What do you need to do to it?
    Initializing the repository creates a .git file to allow git to recognize the folder as a repository
    You still need to add files to track and then execute your first commit
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    Using a staging area allows you to create logical clusters of files to group for commit vs. batch commits or one-off transfers
