Using diff to compare files:

Changes can be compared using diff command, -u indicates unified format (ease of reading output)
Basic function of version control is being able to spot where changes have occured and parse code quickly
We will be using these reflection files to build-out future exercises, so they are important

Question: "How could having easy access to your entire file history make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?"
  - Understand how you thought about problems and tried to solve them
  - Gives you ready to access code that can be reused to solve particular problems
  - Allows you to spot systematic errors and show how you've learned / not learned
  - Allows others to view your work and learn from your process (and vice versa)
